# Getting Started with Symfony project

Develop a Symfony service that consumes an external API to retrieve application-related documents and stores them locally, ensuring files are saved with appropriate naming conventions.Implement error handling to manage failed API requests, invalid data, or issues during file storage.Return appropriate error messages and logs for any failures.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `composure install`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
